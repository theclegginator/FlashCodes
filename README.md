## General info

Flashcodes is an online study resource that helps students learn coding concepts quickly with the help of interactive flashcards. Thanks to our interactive study community, users have generated content about need-to-know terminology, interview questions and code snippets complete with definitions and answers. We have material on many topics including HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, and more! Traditional study materials such as online articles and textbooks are helpful, but donâ€™t help you retain information and recall for later use. With the help of FlashCodes, you can boost your coding knowledge and become a better developer today!
